# Concepts and measures



## What is demography and why is it important?

:::{.rmdnote}
### Definitions of demography {.unnumbered}

* "...the scientific study of human **populations** primarily with respect to their **size**, their **structure** and their **development**; it takes into account the quantitative aspects of their general characteristics. [@population_multilingual_1958]
* The study of human **populations** in relation to the changes brought about by the interplay of **births**, **deaths**, and **migration**. [@pressat1985dictionary]
* "...the study of of human **populations** -- their **size**, **composition** and **distribution** across **space** -- and the **process** through which populations **change**. [@suda_demography]

*Emphasis added.*
:::

**Discussion questions**

<details>
<summary>What are the "processes" that the Stockholm University Demographic Unit's definition drives at? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Birth
* Death
* Migration
</details><br>

<details>
<summary>What are three basic dimensions along which these changes occur? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Time
* Space
* Structure
</details>
<br>

### Okay so what's a "population" then? {.unnumbered}

**For statistians:** A collection of items

**For demographers:**

1. A **collection of persons**...
1. who **meet certain criteria**
1. alive at a **specified point in time**...
<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Anything odd about point 1 above?</summary>
Non-human biologists do demography, too.

* Dr. Hal Caswell, Professor of Mathematical **Demography** at University of Amsterdam: https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/c/a/h.caswell/h.caswell.html
* Wrote influential book on matrix **population models** (aka... **demography**)

> "My research focuses on **population models**, usually based on matrices, for **plants, [non-human] animals, and humans**.  I am interested in stochastic processes in **demography**..."

<details>
<summary>Let's think of some examples.</summary>
* **Collection:** People...
* **Criteria:** living in King County, Washington...
* **Specified point in time:** on April 1, 2019





<center>**2.3 M people**^[1-year American Community Survey 2019 total population estimate]</center>
</details>
<br>

**Also for demographers:**

<center>_Population as an **enduring** collection of individuals_</center>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Extending our Seattle metro example to "enduring" collections</summary>
Now we can see how the population changes, in this case over time...

King County population grew by 28% over 14 years.

### Why is demography important? {.unnumbered}

FILL THIS IN WITH COOL EXAMPLES OF WHAT DEMOGRAPHY CAN DO, PREVIEWING WHAT WE'LL DO IN CLASS, AND WHAT THEY'LL PREPARE TO DO WITH STAT 563.

## The balancing equation of population change

* Consider an observation period of length $T$
* For now, arbitrarily set the period's starting point at time $t = 0$

$\begin{align}
N(T) &= \textsf{ (Ending population size at time } T \textsf{)} \\
     &+ N(0) \textsf{ (Starting population size at time } 0 \textsf{)} \\
     &+ B[0,T] \textsf{ (Number of births from start to end)} \\
     &- D[0,T] \textsf{ (Number of deaths from start to end)} \\
     &+ I[0,T] \textsf{ (Number in-migrations from start to end)} \\
     &- O[0,T] \textsf{ (Number out-migrations from start to end)} \\
\end{align}$

<details>
<summary>Organized by ways to enter vs. exit a population...</summary>
$\begin{align}
N(T) &= N(0) \\
     &+ B[0,T] + I[0,T] \textsf{ (Ways to enter)} \\
     &- D[0,T] - O[0,T] \textsf{ (Ways to exit)}
\end{align}$
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Organized by natural increase vs. net migration...</summary>
$\begin{align}
NI[0,T] &= B[0,T] - D[0,T] \textsf{ (Natural increase)} \\
NM[0,T] &= I[0,T] - O[0,T] \textsf{ (Net migration)}
\end{align}$
</details>

## The structure of demographic rates

For demographers...

$$
\textsf{Rate} =
  \frac{\textsf{Number of occurrences}}
               {\textsf{Person-periods of exposure to the risk of occurrence}}
$$

<details>
<summary>From PHG, what type of rate is this? (Hint: Look in the "equation"!)</summary>
* Occurrence rate, or...
* Exposure rate
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>The book's definition uses "person-years." I used "person-periods." Why?</summary>
* Most traditional demographic rates are annual. Why might that be?
* In some cases, another period length is more appropriate. Example?
</details>

### From lifelines to event counts and person-periods {.unnumbered}

Basic facts

* Consider a group (population?) of individuals denoted $G$
* $A_i$: Beginning of lifeline of individual $i \in G$
* $B_i$: End of individual $i$'s lifeline
* $\theta_{ij}$: The $j$^th^ among $N_i$ occurrences in the lifeline of individual $i$
* $T_i = B_i - A_i$: The length of individual $i$'s lifeline


<details>
<summary>What's another demographic term for $T_i$?</summary>
**PERSON-PERIODS!**
</details>
<br>

Rate for the group defined over their entire lifelines:

$$\textsf{Rate}_G = \frac{\sum_{i \in G} N_i}
{\sum_{i \in G} T_i}$$

A toy example to illustrate...

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/lifelines_plot-1.png" width="672" />

<details><summary>How many **occurrences** in this picture?</summary>
5
</details>
<br>

<details><summary>How many **person-periods**?</summary>
50
</details>
<br>

<details><summary>What is the **life-time rate**?</summary>
5 $\div$ 50 = 10%
</details>
<br>

## Period rates and person-years (er... person-periods)

**Period rate**: A rate that limits occurrence and exposure time to those experienced by a population during a specific period of time:

$$
\textsf{Rate}[0,T] =
  \frac{
    \textsf{Number of occurrencs between time } 0 \textsf{ and } T
  }
  {
    \textsf{Number of person-periods lived between time } 0 \textsf{ and } T
  }
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

People can live fractional (i.e., less than one) person-periods!



**Example:** If you're reading this, you've currently lived 351 person-days, which is 96.2% of a person-year...

... unless, of course, you were born this year! 😆

Either way, congrats. 🥂
:::

Let's illustrate with a toy example:

* A population of 7 people
* Observed over 1 calendar year...

First, let's look at the lifelines of each individual in the population...


<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/individual_person_years_plot-1.png" width="672" />

Now, let's look at how those life lines add up to person-years per quarter...

This shows how the person-years changes from quarter to quarter.

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/person_years_by_quarter_plot-1.png" width="672" />

Let's write down what's going on:

$\begin{align}
PY[0,1] &= \textsf{(The total person-years lived that year)} \\
          &4 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (4 people alive during Q1 times length of quarter in years)} \\
          &6 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (6 people were alive in Q2)} \\
          &5 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (5 folks in Q3)} \\
          &4 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (4 folks in Q4)} \\
          &= 19 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (Total number of person-quarters times length of a quarter)} \\
          &= 4.75 \text{ (The answer!)}
\end{align}$

Using conventional notation:

$PY[0,1] = \sum_1^4 N_i \times \Delta_i$

* $N_i$: Number of persons alive in the $i$^th^ quarter of the year
* $\Delta_i$: Length of a quarter in years
<br><br>

<details>
<summary>What would $\Delta_i$ equal if we counted people each day?</summary>
$\frac{1}{365.25}$

* The book gives 365 as the numerator. Why is 365.25 more accurate?
* Why would $\Delta_i$ be tedious to calculate if we did monthly counts?
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>What would $N_i$ represent if we counted people each day?</summary>
Number of persons alive in the $i$^th^  **day** of the year
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>How could we express $PY[0,1]$ mathematically if we were constantly counting people *ad nauseum* in infinitessimally small units of time of length $dt$?</summary>
<br>
$PY[0,1] = \int_0^1 N(t) \cdot dt$

Or for arbitrary period length $T$:
$PY[0,T] = \int_0^T N(t) \cdot dt$

🤓 Hypothetically, the most frequent count cadence possible is each chronon, and theoretically the most frequent count cadence possible is the Planck time, so maybe that integral is in the end a continuous approximation of quantized time. 🤓

## Principal period rates in demography

* All of these rates are for an entire population
* For each rate, think about this mangled quote from PHG pg. 7 &para; 5:

> As is especially clear from our definition of the crude rate of in-migration, the connection between exposure and event is not always precise in demography

Crude birth rate:

$$\begin{align}
CBR[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of births between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                 {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
         &= \frac{B[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
\end{align}$$

Crude death rate:

$$\begin{align}
CDR[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of deaths between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
         &= \frac{D[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
\end{align}$$

Crude rate of in-migration:

$$\begin{align}
CRIM[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of in-migrations between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                  {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
          &= \frac{I[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
\end{align}$$

Crude rate of out-migration:

$$\begin{align}
CROM[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of in-migrations between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                  {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
          &= \frac{O[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
\end{align}$$

## Growth rates in demography

### Crude growth rate

Recall the balancing equation:

$$N(T) = N[0] + B[0,T] - D[0,T] + I[0,T] - O[0,T]$$

Using some high school algebra, replace the "?" in the equation below:
<details>
<summary>$$
\frac{\textsf{?}}{PY[0,T]} =
  \frac{B[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  - \frac{D[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  + \frac{I[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  - \frac{O[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
$$</summary>
<br>
$N(T) - N(0)$ (The period change in population count)

Step 1: Subtract $N(0)$ from both sides

Step 2: Divide both sides by person-years $PY[0,T]$
<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Putting it all together and substituting in the principal period rates:

$$CGR[0,T] = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{PY[0,T]} = \textsf{?}$$</summary>

$$CBR[0,T] - CDR[0,T] + CRIM[0,T] - CROM[0,T]$$
</details>

<details>
<summary>Arranging by rates related to enters vs. exits</summary>
$$\begin{align}
CGR[0,T] &= \\
         &CBR[0,T] - CDR[0,T] \textsf{ (Crude rate of natural increase } CRNI[0,T] \textsf{)}\\
         &+ CRIM[0,T] - CROM[0,T] \textsf{ (Crude rate of net migration }  CRNM[0,T] \textsf{)} 
\end{align}$$

<summary>Why is a probability always cohort measure?</summary>
Because you have to define the range of possible starting points for observing whether an event occurs.

<summary>Why does a cohort require a specified timeframe?</summary>
Because if you don't specify the end of your observation period, somebody or something else will!

**Example**: All humans eventually die so the following probability is approximately equal to unity (aka 100%) and thus not all that useful:

$$\frac{\textsf{Number of deaths among people born in 1992 from now until the heat death of the universe}}
       {\textsf{Number of people born in 1992}}$$

> In the long run, we are all dead

<summary>How is a cohort an optional feature of a rate?</summary>
You can define a rate (even a period rate) for only those individuals in a cohort.

**Demography example:** Annual birth rate in 1984 among women born in 1956 (I'm in the numerator and my Ma is in the denominator! 👶)

**Employee analytics example:** Annual hiring rate in March 2022 among job openings first posted in January that year
