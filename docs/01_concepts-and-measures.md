## What is demography and why is it important?

:::{.rmdnote}
### Definitions of demography {.unnumbered}

* "...the scientific study of human **populations** primarily with respect to their **size**, their **structure** and their **development**; it takes into account the quantitative aspects of their general characteristics. [@population_multilingual_1958]
* The study of human **populations** in relation to the **changes** brought about by the interplay of **births**, **deaths**, and **migration**. [@pressat1985dictionary]
* "...the study of of human **populations** -- their **size**, **composition** and **distribution** across **space** -- and the **process** through which populations **change**. [@suda_demography]

*Emphasis added.*

**Discussion questions**

<details>
<summary>What are the "processes" that the Stockholm University Demographic Unit's definition drives at? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* **Birth:** Entering the population from the womb
* **Death:** Exiting the population because we're all mortal
* **Migration:** Physically moving in our out of the population's location
</details><br>

<details>
<summary>What are three basic dimensions along which these changes occur? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* **Time:** For example, you can track the number of deaths from year to year
* **Space:** You can track how a population moves its location over time, or how individuals move into our out of a local population over time.
* **Structure:** You can disaggregate a population into subpopulations. For example, by age, by race or ethnicity, by religion, by gender. This structure may change over time.

### Okay so what's a "population" then? {.unnumbered}

**For statistians:** A collection of items

**For demographers:**

1. A **collection of persons**...
1. who **meet certain criteria**
1. alive at a **specified point in time**...
<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Anything odd about point 1 above? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Non-human biologists do demography, too.

* Dr. Hal Caswell, Professor of Mathematical **Demography** at University of Amsterdam: https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/c/a/h.caswell/h.caswell.html
* Wrote influential book on matrix **population models** (aka... **demography**)

> "My research focuses on **population models**, usually based on matrices, for **plants, [non-human] animals, and humans**.  I am interested in stochastic processes in **demography**..."

Now we can see how the population changes, in this case over time...

King County population grew by 28% over 14 years.

## The balancing equation of population change

* Consider an observation period of length $T$
* For now, arbitrarily set the period's starting point at time $t = 0$

$\begin{align}
N(T) &= \textsf{ (Ending population size at time } T \textsf{)} \\
     &+ N(0) \textsf{ (Starting population size at time } 0 \textsf{)} \\
     &+ B[0,T] \textsf{ (Number of births from start to end)} \\
     &- D[0,T] \textsf{ (Number of deaths from start to end)} \\
     &+ I[0,T] \textsf{ (Number in-migrations from start to end)} \\
     &- O[0,T] \textsf{ (Number out-migrations from start to end)} \\
\end{align}$

**DEMOGRAPHY & DATA SCIENCE**

### Balancing equation analogy: A company's employees {#balancing-data-science .unnumbered}

Let's apply this lesson to a population a data scientist might work with:

<center>**A company's employee headcount grows**</center>

Think of analogies to the components of the balancing equation
<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Analogy to births $B[0,T]$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
New hires, BUT...

* Thinking about how birth vs. hiring happen, what's a weaknesses of this analogy?
* Thinking about how some new hires worked at the company before, what's another weakness of the analogy?
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Analogies to deaths $D[0,T]$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
All-cause terminations, BUT...

* Thinking about the state "Death" below, what's a potential weakness of this analogy?
* Where could (at least some terminations) flow instead?

![Balancing equation stock and flow chart again](./images/balancing-equation-stock-flow.svg){width=100%}
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Analogies to in-migrations $I[0,T]$ and out-migrations $O[0,T]$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
If the population is defined as employees at the company:

* Terminations who remain in the workforce (out-migration)
* Re-hires (in-migration)
* Hires from other companies (in-migration again)

If the population is defined as a subset of employees at company:

* Transfers into and out of departments, teams, job functions, etc.

</details>
<br>



**Example:** Below is random sample from a data table of employees from a real Russian company^[Documented here: https://www.kaggle.com/davinwijaya/employee-turnover]:

* **tenure** is the number of months the employee worked at the company
* **left_company** equal 1 if the employee terminated, 0 otherwise
* Notice the other attributes available like **gender** and **age**

From this data, we can easily compute number of total terminations as 571.

We can also disaggregate termination counts by variables, such as....

**Attrition by gender**

* Gender definition and category names aren't inclusive at this employer
* Looks like more women ("f") than men ("m") left the company

<details>
<summary>What information is missing if we want to compare the pace of termination by gender? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Number of employees at risk of leaving the company
* How long those employees were at risk of leaving
</details>

## The structure of demographic rates

For demographers...

$$
\textsf{Rate} =
  \frac{\textsf{Number of occurrences of an event of interest}}
               {\textsf{Person-periods of exposure to the risk of occurrence}}
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

**Person-periods** (e.g., person-years) are the sum across a population of all the time that individuals were exposed to the risk of some event.

<summary>The book's definition uses "person-years." I used "person-periods." Why? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Most traditional demographic rates are annual. Why might that be?

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

A ratio ain't a(n occurrence aka exposure) rate!

**Example:** The U.S. monthly unemployment "rate" ([U-3](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm)) is defined as:

$$\frac{\textsf{Count of the unemployed from Current Population Survey (CPS)}}
       {\textsf{Count of the employed plus unemployed from CPS}}$$

<summary>What about the numerator makes this not a demographic rate? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* It isn't a count of occurrences
* Instead, it's a count of people at a point in time
* Later, we'll see that such counts are an estimate of monthly person-periods

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

Exposure rates weight individuals in the denominator by the number of person-periods they were exposed to the risk of the event.
:::

## Period rates and person-years (er... person-periods)

**Period rate**: A rate that limits occurrence and exposure time to those experienced by a population during a specific period of time:

$$
\textsf{Rate}[0,T] =
  \frac{
    \textsf{Number of occurrences between time } 0 \textsf{ and } T
  }
  {
    \textsf{Number of person-periods lived between time } 0 \textsf{ and } T
  }
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

People can live fractional (i.e., less than one) person-periods!



**Example:** By the time you get your final grade for this course on March 23, 2022, you'll have lived 81 person-days in 2022 so far, which is 22.2% of a person-year...

... unless, of course, you were born this year! 😆

Either way, congrats. 🥂
:::

Let's illustrate with a toy example:

* A population of 7 people
* Observed over 1 calendar year...

First, let's look at the lifelines of each individual in the population...


<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/individual_person_years_plot-1.png" width="672" />

Now, let's look at how those life lines add up to person-years per quarter...

This shows how the person-years changes from quarter to quarter.

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/person_years_by_quarter_plot-1.png" width="672" />

Let's write down what's going on:

$\begin{align}
PY[0,1] &= \textsf{(The total person-years lived that year)} \\
          &4 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (4 people alive during Q1 times length of quarter in years)} \\
          &6 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (6 people were alive in Q2)} \\
          &5 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (5 folks in Q3)} \\
          &4 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (4 folks in Q4)} \\
          &= 19 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (Total number of person-quarters times length of a quarter)} \\
          &= 4.75 \text{ (The answer!)}
\end{align}$

Using conventional notation:

$PY[0,1] = \sum_1^4 N_i \times \Delta_i$

* $N_i$: Number of persons alive in the $i$^th^ quarter of the year
* $\Delta_i$: Fraction of a year represented by that quarter (0.25 if the whole quarter is represented)
<br><br>

Or more generally, for $P$ discrete chunks of a period of potentially unequal length:

$PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i$

<details>
<summary>What would $\Delta_i$ equal if we counted people each day in 2021? **Tap for answer**</summary>
$\frac{1}{365}$

* For 2024, it would be 366 because it's a leap year
* If our rate spanned across a multiple of four years, it would be 365.25 to account for leap and non-leap years
* Why would $\Delta_i$ be tedious to calculate if we did monthly counts?

<details>
<summary>How could we express $PY[0,1]$ mathematically if we were constantly counting people *ad nauseum* in infinitessimally small units of time of length $dt$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
<br>
$PY[0,1] = \int_0^1 N(t) \cdot dt$

Or for arbitrary period length $T$:
$PY[0,T] = \int_0^T N(t) \cdot dt$

🤓 Hypothetically, the most frequent count cadence possible is each chronon, and theoretically the most frequent count cadence possible is the Planck time, so maybe that integral is in the end a continuous approximation of quantized time. 🤓

### Crude growth rate

The crude growth rate combines the [Principal period rates in demography] into an expression of how a population grows between two time points

Recall the balancing equation:

$$N(T) = N[0] + B[0,T] - D[0,T] + I[0,T] - O[0,T]$$

Using some high school algebra, replace the "?" in the equation below:
<details>
<summary>$$
\frac{\textsf{?}}{PY[0,T]} =
  \frac{B[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  - \frac{D[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  + \frac{I[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  - \frac{O[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
$$ **Tap for answer**</summary>
<br>
$N(T) - N(0)$ (The period change in population count)

Step 1: Subtract $N(0)$ from both sides

Step 2: Divide both sides by person-years $PY[0,T]$
<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Putting it all together and substituting in the principal period rates:

$$CGR[0,T] = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{PY[0,T]} = \textsf{?}$$ **Tap for answer**</summary>

$$CBR[0,T] - CDR[0,T] + CRIM[0,T] - CROM[0,T]$$
</details>

<details>
<summary>Arranging by rates related to enters vs. exits **Tap for answer**</summary>

CGR[0,T] &= \\

         &+ CRIM[0,T] - CROM[0,T] \textsf{ (Crude rate of net migration }  CRNM[0,T] \textsf{)} 
\end{align}$$
</details>

### Instantaneous growth rate

CGR measures growth between two time points $0$ and $T$, but what about the pace of population growth at a specific point in time $0 < t < T$?

* Define period length $\Delta t$
* Population change $N(t + \Delta t) - N(t) = \Delta N(t)$ (Just a generalization of $N(1) - N(0)$)
* Person-years lived now $N(t)\Delta t$ (Note similarity to $PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i$. Here, $P = 1$ since we are concerned with only one small interval of time for the whole period.)
* So crude growth rate now $r(t) = \frac{\Delta N(t)}{N(t) \Delta t}$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

Instantaneous growth rate is essentially a crude growth rate over tiny period of length $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$

Mathematically^[I'll spare you the derivation from PHG pg. 9, but if you're interested in it and confused about it, talk to me during office hours.]:

\begin{equation}
  r(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta N(t)}{N(t) \Delta t}
       =\frac{d \text{ln}\left[N(t)\right]}{dt}
  (\#eq:instantaneousgrowthrate)
\end{equation}
:::

We can do algebra and some calculus using Equation \@ref(eq:instantaneousgrowthrate) to express how instantaneous growth accumulates between times $0$ and $T$^[Again, I'll spare the derivation from PHG ph. 11, but let me know if you're interested and/or confused by it]:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{N(T)}{N(0)} = e^{\int_0^T r(t)dt}
  (\#eq:generalcumulativegrowth)
\end{equation}

* Left-hand side: Ratio of ending to starting population size
* Right-hand side:  Expression for cumulative growth

Re-arranging:

\begin{equation}
  N(T) = N(0)e^{\int_0^T r(t)dt}
  (\#eq:generalgrowthequation)
\end{equation}

Assuming constant growth rate $r^*$ (and sparing derivation on PHG pg. 11):

\begin{equation}
  N(T) = N(0)e^{r^{*} T}
  (\#eq:constantgrowthequation)
\end{equation}

Dividing both sides by starting population $N(0)$, we see get an expression for the cumulative growth between times $0$ and $T$ under constant rate $r^*$:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{N(T)}{N(0)} = e^{r^* T}
  (\#eq:constantcumulativegrowth)
\end{equation}

Taking the logarithm of both sides of Equation \@ref(eq:constantcumulativegrowth) and dividing by $T$ gives us the constant growth rate $r^*$ between times $0$ and $T$:

\begin{equation}
  r^{*} = \frac{\text{ln} \left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}{T}
  (\#eq:constantgrowthexpression)
\end{equation}

### Mean annualized growth rate

If we take the logarithm of both sides of \@ref(eq:generalcumulativegrowth) then divided by $T$, we get:

$$
  \frac{\int_0^T r(t)dt}{T} = \frac{\text{ln} \left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}{T}
$$

The left-hand side is just the mean growth rate $\bar{r}[0,T]$, so:

\begin{equation}
  \bar{r}[0,T] = \frac{\text{ln} \left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}{T}
  (\#eq:meanannualizedgrowthrate)
\end{equation}

The left-hand side is known as the **mean annualized growth rate**.

### Doubling time

If population doubles:

* $N(T)/N(0) = 2$ (definition of doubling)
* So $\text{ln}\left[N(T)/N(0)\right] = \text{ln}[2] \approx 0.693$

Assuming constant growth $r^*$ and plugging 0.693 into Equation \@ref(eq:constantgrowthexpression):

$$\textsf{Doubling time} \approx \frac{0.693}{r^*}$$

### Comparison of crude growth rate and mean annualized growth rate

Why does $CGR = \overline{r}$ only when growth rate is constant? Let's examine three scenarios: early growth, late growth, and constant growth.

Look at the picture below:

![Fig 1.2 from PHG. Three scenarios of within-period growth](./images/magr-vs-cgr-phg-fig-1p2.jpg){width=100%}

* Starting and ending population sizes $N(0)$ and $N(T)$ are all the same
* Thus numerators of the crude growth rates $N(0) - N(T)$ are all the same
* Yet person years (areas under the curves) definitely aren't the same! That is:

$$PY[0,T]_{\text{early growth}} \neq PY[0,T]_{\text{late growth}} \neq PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}}$$

* Therefore the crude growth rates won't be equal either, that is:

$$
\frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{early growth}}}
\neq \frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{late growth}}}
\neq \frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}}}
= r^*
$$

* Under constant growth rate $r^*[0,T]$, person-years lived is:

$$
\require{cancel}
PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}} = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r^*}
$$

* Thus CGR under $r^*[0,1]$ is:

$$
CGR[0,T]
  = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{\left[\frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r^*}\right]}
  = \left[\bcancel{N(T) - N(0)}\right]
  \cdot \frac{r^*}{\bcancel{N(T) - N(0)}}
  = r^*
$$

* Meanwhile, under $r^*[0,1]$:

$$
\overline{r}[0,T] = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^Tr^*dt=r^*
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

With few exceptions, crude growth rate and mean annualized growth rate are not equal unless there is constant growth rate $r^*$.

</details>

:::

## Estimating period person-periods {#estimating-person-periods}

* Often, we don't have access to data on individual lifelines
* **Consequence:** We have to estimate person-periods to calculate rates



### Method 1: Assume constant growth rate $r$ during the period {.unnumbered}

We just saw that under constant growth rate $r^*$:

$$
r^* = CGR[0,T] = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{PY[0,T]}
$$

Solving this equation for $PY[0,T]$ yields:

$$
PY[0,T] = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r^*}
$$

Plugging in the right-hand side of Equation \@ref(eq:constantgrowthexpression) (our original expression for $r^*$ before we found it was also equal to $CGR[0,T]$) and simplifying yields a handy approximation of person-years that requires only the starting and ending population size and the period length:

\begin{equation}
    PY[0,T] = \frac{
              \left[N(T) - N(0)\right] \cdot T
            }{
              \text{ln}\left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]
            }
  (\#eq:pyconstantgrowth)
\end{equation}

If the number of years $T = 1$, this becomes:

$$
PY[0,1] = \frac{N(1) - N(0)}{
            \text{ln}\left[\frac{N(1)}{N(0)}\right]
          }
$$

### Method 2: Use mid-period population  {.unnumbered}

* Often, demographers don't have both start and ending population
* Instead, they have a mid-period population count
* Example: Decennial U.S. Census
* Mid-period population estimate works best when within-period growth is linear
<br>

Below are two scenarios of linear population change.

* The black dot shows when within-period population = $PY[0,1]$
* Notice how it's at mid-period
* Note how the mid-period's under-estimate in one half of the year is balanced by an over-estimate in the other half of the year

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/linear_growth_plots-1.png" width="672" />

Below are scenarios of exponentially changing populations.

* Notice how mid-period population $\neq PY[0,1]$
* Mid-period population **under**-estimates $PY[0,1]$ in both cases. Why?

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/exponential_growth_plots-1.png" width="672" />

As periods get shorter, the linear approximation gets better

### Method 3: Average of starting and ending population counts {#person-periods-method3 .unnumbered}

* Sometimes, you don't have mid-period population $N(T/2)$
* So long as you've collected data in $\geq$ 2 consecutive years, you've got $N(0)$ and $N(T)$
* Like mid-period population, the average $\left(N(0) + N(T)\right)/2$ also assumes linear growth

<details>
<summary>Why does average of starting and ending population assume linear growth? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Remember the midpoint formula for the mid-point between two points on a line?

$$\left(x_m,y_m\right) = \left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$$

Draw a line between $N(0)$ at time $0$ and $N(T)$ at time $T$.

Plug in for times $0$ and $T$ for the $x_i$ values and populations $N(t)$ for for $y_i$

$$\left(t_m,N_m\right) = \left(\frac{0+T}{2},\frac{N(0)+N(1)}{2}\right)
                       = \left(T/2,\frac{N(0)+N(1)}{2}\right)$$

* Starting-ending average $\left(N(0)+N(1)\right/2$ is the mid-points's $y$ coordinate
* Mid-period $T/2$ is the mid-point's $x$ coordinate
* Therefore the starting-ending average occurs at the mid-period
* Recall that a mid-period approximation assumes linear $N(t)$
</details>

<details>
<summary>Since both a mid-period approximation and a start-ending average approximation of $PY$ assume $N(T)$ is linear, does that mean they produce the same estimate of $PY$?</summary>
Not unless $N(t)$ is in fact linear.

* With mid-period approximation, you assume $PY = N(T/2) = \frac{1}{2} \left[N(0) + N(T)\right]$ but don't know $N(0)$ or $N(T)$
* With start-ending average, you assume the same thing, but don't know $N(T/2)$
* Yet if $N(t)$ is non-linear, $N(T/2) \neq \frac{1}{2} \left[N(0) + N(T)\right]$
</details>

### Method 4: Average of population counts at evenly spaced intervals {.unnumbered}

* Recall $PY[0,T] = \sum_{i=1}^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i$
* For $P$ equally-sized intervals, this becomes $PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \frac{1}{P}$
* This is simply the average of the per-interval population counts
* Higher resolution (i.e., higher $P$) means better $PY[0,T]$ approximation

To illustrate, let's draw some graphs of average mid-interval estimates at different resolutions.

**DEMOGRAPHY & DATA SCIENCE**

### The promise (and peril) of knowing exact person years {#promise-and-peril .unnumbered}

In many business settings, data scientists have access to exact dates when individuals enter and exit a population.

<details>
<summary>What advantages does this provide? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Precise estimation of person-periods
* Thus precise estimation of rates
* Flexible aggregation of occurrences in person-periods
</details>
<br>

Here's an example of the flexibility of exact person year data. Recall the [attrition dataset](#balancing-data-science) we worked with in our section on the balancing equation 

<details>
<summary>Below is again a table of the raw data. Which variable would be summed into the numerator of an all-cause termination rate? The denominator? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Sum of `left_company` is the occurrence in the numerator
* Sum of `tenure` is the person-periods (specifically person-months) in the denominator

<summary>Below is the sum of terminations (`number_terminations`) and person-months (`employee_months`) for every combination of variables `gender`, `age`, `industry`, `commute_type`, `manager_gender`, along with the resulting `annualized_termination_rate`. How is an annual termination rate derived from terminations and person-months?</summary>
* If you already have the monthly rate: Multiply it by 12
* Or you could have divided `employee_months` by 12 to get `employee_years`

The beauty of exact person-periods is now we can get the same rates for a grouping of variables in one of two ways:

* If starting with individual-level data, sum the *individual* occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate
* If starting with pre-aggregated data, sum the *aggregated* occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate

Below is an example, summing the aggregates above to derive annualized termination rates by gender:

<summary>What types of errors would you expect to see in exact person-year data? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Exit date happened before entrance date
* Missing exit date even if individual labeled as an exit
* Missing entrance date even if there is an exit date
* Exit and entrance dates both far into the future
* Forgetting far-future exit dates are default values for no event

I have seen all of these and more. Thank now about how you'd deal with them.

## The concept of a cohort

:::{.rmdimportant}
A **cohort** is an a group of individuals in a population that experience a specific event during a specific time interval.

* **Example:** People born in the U.S between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 1992
:::

Returning to our lifelines plot:

* Red rectangle shows time interval for qualifying events $\theta$

<details>
<summary>Which individuals are in the cohort? **Tap for answer**</summary>
$A_4$ only
</details>

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/cohort_illustration-1.png" width="672" />


Can you think of any examples of a cohort outside of traditional demography?

* Customer analytics?
* Employee analytics?
* Mechanical engineering?
* Plant biology?
* Something else?

## Probabilities of occurrence of events

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

**Probabilities** measure the **chance** an event occurs in a **cohort** within **a specific timeframe**

$$
\textsf{Probability} = \frac{
  \textsf{Number of occurrences }
}{
  \color{darkorange}{\textsf{Number of preceding events or trials}}
}
$$

Probabilities also specify a window of observation from...
  
* when the "preceding event or trial" qualifies for inclusion in the cohort...
* ... until either the event occurs or the individual stops being observed

The maximal observation time needs to be same for each member of the cohort

Therefore each individual counted in the denominator needs to have been observed for at least as long as the duration of the observation window

**Rates** measure the the **pace** of occurrences per person-year in a **population**

$$
\textsf{Rate} = \frac{
  \textsf{Number of occurrences} 
}{
  \color{dodgerblue}{\textsf{Number of person-periods lived}}
}
$$

Rates specify a window of observation, as well, but its starting point is not defined by entry of an individual into a cohort.

Instead, it's defined by the start of the period of observation.

All occurrences and person-periods lived within observation window are counted

No occurrences or person-periods outside the observation window are counted
:::

A lot of this will make way more sense when we study Lexis diagrams

<details>
<summary>Why does a probability require an observation window with a starting and ending point? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Because if you don't specify the end of your observation period, somebody or something else will!

**Example**: All humans eventually die so the following probability is approximately equal to unity (aka 100%) and thus not all that useful:

$$
\frac{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \textsf{Number of deaths among people born in 1992} \\
    \textsf{from now until the heat death of the universe}
  \end{pmatrix}
}
{(\textsf{Number of people born in 1992})}
$$
