## What is demography and why is it important?

:::{.rmdnote}
### Definitions of demography {.unnumbered}

* "...the scientific study of human **populations** primarily with respect to their **size**, their **structure** and their **development**; it takes into account the quantitative aspects of their general characteristics. [@population_multilingual_1958]
* The study of human **populations** in relation to the **changes** brought about by the interplay of **births**, **deaths**, and **migration**. [@pressat1985dictionary]
* "...the study of of human **populations** -- their **size**, **composition** and **distribution** across **space** -- and the **process** through which populations **change**. [@suda_demography]

*Emphasis added.*

**Discussion questions**

<details>
<summary>What are the "processes" that the Stockholm University Demographic Unit's definition drives at? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* **Birth:** Entering the population from the womb
* **Death:** Exiting the population because we're all mortal
* **Migration:** Physically moving in our out of the population's location
</details><br>

<details>
<summary>What are three basic dimensions along which these changes occur? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* **Time:** For example, you can track the number of deaths from year to year
* **Space:** You can track how a population moves its location over time, or how individuals move into our out of a local population over time.
* **Structure:** You can disaggregate a population into subpopulations. For example, by age, by race or ethnicity, by religion, by gender. This structure may change over time.

### Okay so what's a "population" then? {.unnumbered}

**For statistians:** A collection of items

**For demographers:**

1. A **collection of persons**...
1. who **meet certain criteria**
1. alive at a **specified point in time**...
<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Anything odd about point 1 above? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Non-human biologists do demography, too.

* Dr. Hal Caswell, Professor of Mathematical **Demography** at University of Amsterdam: https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/c/a/h.caswell/h.caswell.html
* Wrote influential book on matrix **population models** (aka... **demography**)

> "My research focuses on **population models**, usually based on matrices, for **plants, [non-human] animals, and humans**.  I am interested in stochastic processes in **demography**..."

**Also for demographers:**

<center>_Population as an **enduring** collection of individuals_</center>

By "enduring", PHG mean those characteristics of a population that don't change.

Now we can see how the population changes, in this case over time...

King County population grew by 28% over 14 years.

## The balancing equation of population change

* Consider an observation period of length $T$
* For now, arbitrarily set the period's starting point at time $t = 0$

$\begin{align}
N(T) &= \textsf{ (Ending population size at time } T \textsf{)} \\
     &+ N(0) \textsf{ (Starting population size at time } 0 \textsf{)} \\
     &+ B[0,T] \textsf{ (Number of births from start to end)} \\
     &- D[0,T] \textsf{ (Number of deaths from start to end)} \\
     &+ I[0,T] \textsf{ (Number in-migrations from start to end)} \\
     &- O[0,T] \textsf{ (Number out-migrations from start to end)} \\
\end{align}$

**DEMOGRAPHY & DATA SCIENCE**

### Balancing equation analogy: A company's employees {#balancing-data-science .unnumbered}

Let's apply this lesson to a population a data scientist might work with:

<center>**A company's employee headcount grows**</center>

Think of analogies to the components of the balancing equation
<br><br>

<details>
<summary>Analogy to births $B[0,T]$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
New hires, BUT...

* Thinking about how birth vs. hiring happen, what's a weaknesses of this analogy?
* Thinking about how some new hires worked at the company before, what's another weakness of the analogy?
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Analogies to deaths $D[0,T]$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
All-cause terminations, BUT...

* Thinking about the state "Death" below, what's a potential weakness of this analogy?
* Where could (at least some terminations) flow instead?

![Balancing equation stock and flow chart again](./images/balancing-equation-stock-flow.svg){width=100%}
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Analogies to in-migrations $I[0,T]$ and out-migrations $O[0,T]$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
If the population is defined as employees at the company:

* Terminations who remain in the workforce (out-migration)
* Re-hires (in-migration)
* Hires from other companies (in-migration again)

If the population is defined as a subset of employees at company:

* Transfers into and out of departments, teams, job functions, etc.

</details>
<br>



**Example:** Below is random sample from a data table of employees from a real Russian company^[Documented here: https://www.kaggle.com/davinwijaya/employee-turnover]:

* **tenure** is the number of months the employee worked at the company
* **left_company** equal 1 if the employee terminated, 0 otherwise
* Notice the other attributes available like **gender** and **age**

```

From this data, we can easily compute number of total terminations as 571.

We can also disaggregate termination counts by variables, such as....

**Attrition by gender**

* Gender definition and category names aren't inclusive at this employer
* Looks like more women ("f") than men ("m") left the company

<details>
<summary>What information is missing if we want to compare the pace of termination by gender? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Number of employees at risk of leaving the company
* How long those employees were at risk of leaving
</details>

## The structure of demographic rates

For demographers...

$$
\textsf{Rate} =
  \frac{\textsf{Number of occurrences of an event of interest}}
               {\textsf{Person-periods of exposure to the risk of occurrence}}
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

**Person-periods** (e.g., person-years) are the sum across a population of all the time that individuals were exposed to the risk of some event.

<details>
<summary>The book's definition uses "person-years." I used "person-periods." Why? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Most traditional demographic rates are annual. Why might that be?
* In some cases, period length longer or shorter than a calendar year is more appropriate. Example?

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

A ratio ain't a(n occurrence aka exposure) rate!

**Example:** The U.S. monthly unemployment "rate" ([U-3](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm)) is defined as:

$$\frac{\textsf{Count of the unemployed from Current Population Survey (CPS)}}
       {\textsf{Count of the employed plus unemployed from CPS}}$$

<details>
<summary>What about the numerator makes this not a demographic rate? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* It isn't a count of occurrences
* Instead, it's a count of people at a point in time
* Later, we'll see that such counts are an estimate of monthly person-periods

<details>
<summary>What about the denominator makes this a funky unemployment "rate"? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Unemployed people aren't at risk of becoming unemployed

### From lifelines to event counts and person-periods {.unnumbered}

Basic facts

* Consider a group (population?) of individuals denoted $G$
* $A_i$: Beginning of lifeline of individual $i \in G$
* $B_i$: End of individual $i$'s lifeline
* $\theta_{ij}$: The $j$^th^ among $N_i$ occurrences in the lifeline of individual $i$
* $T_i = B_i - A_i$: The length of individual $i$'s lifeline

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

Exposure rates weight individuals in the denominator by the number of person-periods they were exposed to the risk of the event.
:::

## Period rates and person-years (er... person-periods)

**Period rate**: A rate that limits occurrence and exposure time to those experienced by a population during a specific period of time:

$$
\textsf{Rate}[0,T] =
  \frac{
    \textsf{Number of occurrences between time } 0 \textsf{ and } T
  }
  {
    \textsf{Number of person-periods lived between time } 0 \textsf{ and } T
  }
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

People can live fractional (i.e., less than one) person-periods!



**Example:** By the time you get your final grade for this course on March 23, 2022, you'll have lived 81 person-days in 2022 so far, which is 22.2% of a person-year...

... unless, of course, you were born this year! 😆

Either way, congrats. 🥂
:::

Let's illustrate with a toy example:

* A population of 7 people
* Observed over 1 calendar year...

First, let's look at the lifelines of each individual in the population...


<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/individual_person_years_plot-1.png" width="672" />

Now, let's look at how those life lines add up to person-years per quarter...

This shows how the person-years changes from quarter to quarter.

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/person_years_by_quarter_plot-1.png" width="672" />

Let's write down what's going on:

$\begin{align}
PY[0,1] &= \textsf{(The total person-years lived that year)} \\
          &4 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (4 people alive during Q1 times length of quarter in years)} \\
          &6 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (6 people were alive in Q2)} \\
          &5 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (5 folks in Q3)} \\
          &4 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (4 folks in Q4)} \\
          &= 19 \times 0.25 \textsf{ (Total number of person-quarters times length of a quarter)} \\
          &= 4.75 \text{ (The answer!)}
\end{align}$

Using conventional notation:

$PY[0,1] = \sum_1^4 N_i \times \Delta_i$

* $N_i$: Number of persons alive in the $i$^th^ quarter of the year
* $\Delta_i$: Fraction of a year represented by that quarter (0.25 if the whole quarter is represented)
<br><br>

Or more generally, for $P$ discrete chunks of a period of potentially unequal length:

$PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i$

<details>
<summary>What would $\Delta_i$ equal if we counted people each day in 2021? **Tap for answer**</summary>
$\frac{1}{365}$

* For 2022, it would be 366 because it's a leap year
* If our rate spanned across a multiple of four years, it would be 365.25 to account for leap and non-leap years
* Why would $\Delta_i$ be tedious to calculate if we did monthly counts?

<details>
<summary>What would $N_i$ represent if we counted people each day in a year? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Number of persons alive on the $i$^th^ day of the year

<details>
<summary>How could we express $PY[0,1]$ mathematically if we were constantly counting people *ad nauseum* in infinitessimally small units of time of length $dt$? **Tap for answer**</summary>
<br>
$PY[0,1] = \int_0^1 N(t) \cdot dt$

Or for arbitrary period length $T$:
$PY[0,T] = \int_0^T N(t) \cdot dt$

🤓 Hypothetically, the most frequent count cadence possible is each chronon, and theoretically the most frequent count cadence possible is the Planck time, so maybe that integral is in the end a continuous approximation of quantized time. 🤓

## Principal period rates in demography

* All of these rates are for an entire population
* For each rate, think about this mangled quote from PHG pg. 7 &para; 5:

> As is especially clear from our definition of the crude rate of in-migration, the connection between exposure and event is not always precise in demography

Crude birth rate:

$$\begin{align}
CBR[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of births between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                 {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
         &= \frac{B[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
\end{align}$$

Crude death rate:

$$\begin{align}
CDR[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of deaths between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
         &= \frac{D[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}

Crude rate of in-migration:

                  {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
          &= \frac{I[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}

Crude rate of out-migration:

$$\begin{align}
CROM[0,T] &= \frac{\textsf{Number of out-migrations between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T}
                  {\textsf{Person-years lived between times } 0 \textsf{ and } T} \\
          &= \frac{O[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
\end{align}$$

## Growth rates in demography

### Crude growth rate

Recall the balancing equation:

$$N(T) = N[0] + B[0,T] - D[0,T] + I[0,T] - O[0,T]$$

Using some high school algebra, replace the "?" in the equation below:
<details>
<summary>$$
\frac{\textsf{?}}{PY[0,T]} =
  \frac{B[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  - \frac{D[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  + \frac{I[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
  - \frac{O[0,T]}{PY[0,T]}
$$ **Tap for answer**</summary>
<br>
$N(T) - N(0)$ (The period change in population count)

Step 1: Subtract $N(0)$ from both sides

Step 2: Divide both sides by person-years $PY[0,T]$

         &+ CRIM[0,T] - CROM[0,T] \textsf{ (Crude rate of net migration }  CRNM[0,T] \textsf{)} 
\end{align}$$
</details>

### Instantaneous growth rate

* Define period length $\Delta t$
* Population change $N(t + \Delta t) - N(t) = \Delta N(t)$^[Just a generalization of $N(1) - N(0)$]
* Person-years lived now $N(t)\Delta t$^[Note similarity to $PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i$. Here, $P = 1$ since we are concerned with only one small interval of time for the whole period.]
* So crude growth rate now $r(t) = \frac{\Delta N(t)}{N(t) \Delta t}$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

Instantaneous growth rate = crude growth rate over tiny period $\Delta t$

Mathematically^[I'll spare you the derivation from PHG pg. 9, but if you're interested in it and confused about it, talk to me during office hours.]:

\begin{equation}
  r(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta N(t)}{N(t) \Delta t}
       =\frac{d \text{ln}\left[N(t)\right]}{dt}
  (\#eq:instantaneousgrowthrate)
\end{equation}
:::

We can do algebra using Equation \@ref(eq:instantaneousgrowthrate) to express how instantaneous growth accumulates between times $0$ and $T$^[Again, I'll spare the derivation from PHG ph. 11, but let me know if you're interested and/or confused by it]:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{N(T)}{N(0)} = e^{\int_0^T r(t)dt}
  (\#eq:generalcumulativegrowth)
\end{equation}

* Left-hand side: Ratio of ending to starting population size
* Right-hand side:  Expression for cumulative growth

Re-arranging:

\begin{equation}
  N(T) = N(0)e^{\int_0^T r(t)dt}
  (\#eq:generalgrowthequation)
\end{equation}

Assuming constant growth rate $r^*$^[And sparing the derivation at the bottom of PHG pg. 11]:

\begin{equation}
  N(T) = N(0)e^{r^{*} T}
  (\#eq:constantgrowthequation)
\end{equation}

Dividing both sides by starting population $N(0)$, we see get an expression for the cumulative growth between times $0$ and $T$ under constant rate $r^*$:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{N(T)}{N(0)} = e^{r^* T}
  (\#eq:constantcumulativegrowth)
\end{equation}

Exponentiating both sides of Equation \@ref(eq:constantcumulativegrowth) and dividing by $T$ gives us the constant growth rate $r^*$ in effect between times $0$ and $T$:

\begin{equation}
  r^{*} = \frac{\text{ln} \left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}{T}
  (\#eq:constantgrowthexpression)
\end{equation}

### Mean annualized growth rate

If we exponentiate both sides of \@ref(eq:generalcumulativegrowth) then divided by $T$, we get:

$$
  \frac{\int_0^T r(t)dt}{T} = \frac{\text{ln} \left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}{T}
$$

The left-hand side is just the mean growth rate $\bar{r}[0,T]$, so:

\begin{equation}
  \bar{r}[0,T] = \frac{\text{ln} \left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}{T}
  (\#eq:meanannualizedgrowthrate)
\end{equation}

The left-hand side is known as the **mean annualized growth rate**.

<details>
<summary>Comparing the mean annualized growth rate from Equation \@ref(eq:meanannualizedgrowthrate) to the constant growth rate from Equation \@ref(eq:constantgrowthexpression), what is the only condition we can be sure mean annualized and crude growth rates are equal?</summary>
Constant growth rate $r^*$
</details>

### Doubling time

If population doubles:

* $N(T)/N(0) = 2$ (definition of doubling)
* So $\text{ln}\left[N(T)/N(0)\right] = \text{ln}[2] \approx 0.693$

Assuming constant growth $r^*$ and plugging 0.693 into Equation \@ref(eq:constantgrowthexpression):

$$\textsf{Doubling time} \approx \frac{0.693}{r^*}$$

### Comparison of crude growth rate and mean annualized growth rate

Why does $CDR = \overline{r}$ only when growth rate is constant? Let's examine three scenarios: early growth, late growth, and constant growth.

Look at the picture below

![Fig 1.2 from PHG. Three scenarios of within-period growth](./images/magr-vs-cgr-phg-fig-1p2.jpg){width=100%}

:

* Starting and ending population sizes $N(0)$ and $N(T)$ are all the same
* Thus numerators of the crude growth rates $N(0) - N(T)$ are all the same
* Yet person years (areas under the curves) definitely aren't the same! That is:

$$PY[0,T]_{\text{early growth}} \neq PY[0,T]_{\text{late growth}} \neq PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}}$$

* Therefore the crude growth rates won't be equal either, that is:

$$
\frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{early growth}}}
\neq \frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{late growth}}}
\neq \frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}}}
= r^*
$$

* Under constant growth rate $r^*[0,T]$, person-years lived is:

$$
\require{cancel}
PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}} = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r^*}
$$

* Thus CGR under $r^*[0,1]$ is:

$$
CGR[0,T]
  = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{\left[\frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r^*}\right]}
  = \left[\bcancel{N(T) - N(0)}\right]
  \cdot \frac{r^*}{\bcancel{N(T) - N(0)}}
  = r^*
$$

* Meanwhile, under $r^*[0,1]$:

$$
\overline{r}[0,T] = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^Tr^*dt=r^*
$$

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

With few exceptions, crude growth rate and mean annualized growth rate are not equal unless there is constant growth rate $r^*$.

<details>
<summary>Under what circumstances of growth rates and period lengths could we reasonably assume constant growth rate?</summary>
If period length is small relative to the pace at which growth rates change
</details>

:::

## Estimating period person-periods {#estimating-person-periods}

* Often, we don't have access to data on individual lifelines
* **Consequence:** We have to estimate person-periods to calculate rates



### Method 1: Assume constant growth rate $r$ during the period {.unnumbered}

On pgs 13-14, PHG show that if you assume constant growth rate $r^*$, you can estimate person years using starting and ending population counts:

\begin{equation}
    PY[0,T] = \frac{\left[N(T) - N(0)\right] \cdot T}{r^*[0,T]}
            = \frac{
              \left[N(T) - N(0)\right] \cdot T
            }{
              \text{ln}\left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]
            }
  (\#eq:pyconstantgrowth)
\end{equation}

If the number of years $T = 1$, this becomes:

$$
PY[0,1] = \frac{N(1) - N(0)}{
            \text{ln}\left[\frac{N(1)}{N(0)}\right]
          }
$$

### Method 2: Use mid-period population  {.unnumbered}

* Often, demographers don't have both start and ending population
* Instead, they have a mid-period population count
* Example: Decennial U.S. Census
* Mid-period population estimate works best when within-period growth is linear
<br>

Below are two scenarios of linear population change.

* The black dot shows when within-period population = $PY[0,1]$
* Notice how it's at mid-period
* Note how the mid-period's under-estimate in one half of the year is balanced by an over-estimate in the other half of the year

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/linear_growth_plots-1.png" width="672" />

Below are scenarios of exponentially changing populations.

* Notice how mid-period population $\neq PY[0,1]$
* Mid-period population **under**-estimates $PY[0,1]$ in both cases. Why?

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/exponential_growth_plots-1.png" width="672" />

As periods get shorter, the linear approximation gets better

### Method 3: Mean of starting and ending population counts {#person-periods-method3 .unnumbered}

* Sometimes, you don't have mid-period population $N(T/2)$
* So long as you've collected data in $\geq$ 2 consecutive years, you've got $N(0)$ and $N(T)$
* Like mid-period population, the mean $\left(N(0) + N(T)\right)/2$ also assumes linear growth

<details>
<summary>Why does average of starting and ending population assume linear growth? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Remember the midpoint formula for the mid-point between two points on a line?

$$\left(x_m,y_m\right) = \left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$$

Draw a line between $N(0)$ at time $0$ and $N(T)$ at time $T$.

Plug in for times $0$ and $T$ for the $x_i$ values and populations $N(t)$ for for $y_i$

$$\left(N_m,t_m\right) = \left(\frac{0+T}{2},\frac{N(0)+N(1)}{2}\right)
                       = \left(T/2,\frac{N(0)+N(1)}{2}\right)$$

Mean population $\left(N(0)+N(1)\right/2$ is the mid-points's $y$ coordinate

Mid-period $T/2$ is the $x$ coordinate
</details>

### Method 4: Mean of mid-interval population counts at evenly spaced intervals {.unnumbered}

* Recall $PY[0,T] = \sum_{i=1}^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i$
* For $P$ equally-sized intervals, this becomes $PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \frac{1}{P}$
* This is simply the average of the per-interval population counts
* Higher resolution (i.e., higher $P$) means better $PY[0,T]$ approximation

To illustrate, let's draw some graphs of average mid-interval estimates at different resolutions.

**DEMOGRAPHY & DATA SCIENCE**

### The promise (and peril) of knowing exact person years {.unnumbered}

In many business settings, data scientists have access to exact dates when individuals enter and exit a population.

<details>
<summary>What advantages does this provide? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Precise estimation of person-periods
* Thus precise estimation of rates
* Flexible aggregation of occurrences in person-periods
</details>
<br>

Here's an example of the flexibility of exact person year data. Recall the [attrition dataset](#balancing-data-science) we worked with in our section on the balancing equation 

<details>
<summary>Below is again a table of the raw data. Which variable would be summed into the numerator of an all-cause termination rate? The denominator? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Sum of `left_company` is the occurrence in the numerator
* Sum of `tenure` is the person-periods (specifically person-months) in the denominator

<summary>Below is the sum of terminations (`number_terminations`) and person-months (`employee_months`) for every combination of variables `gender`, `age`, `industry`, `commute_type`, `manager_gender`, along with the resulting `annualized_termination_rate`. How is an annual termination rate derived from terminations and person-months?</summary>
* If you already have the monthly rate: Multiply it by 12
* Or you could have divided `employee_months` by 12 to get `employee_years`

The beauty of exact person-periods is now we can get the same rates for a grouping of variables in one of two ways:

* If starting with individual-level data, sum the *individual* occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate
* If starting with pre-aggregated data, sum the *aggregated* occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate

Below is an example, summing the aggregates above to derive annualized termination rates by gender:


```{=html}

<summary>What types of errors would you expect to see in exact person-year data? **Tap for answer**</summary>
* Exit date happened before entrance date
* Missing exit date even if individual labeled as an exit
* Missing entrance date even if there is an exit date
* Exit and entrance dates both far into the future
* Forgetting far-future exit dates are default values for no event

I have seen all of these and more. Thank now about how you'd deal with them.

## The concept of a cohort

:::{.rmdimportant}
A **cohort** is an a group of individuals in a population that experience a specific event during a specific time interval.

* **Example:** People born in the U.S between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 1992
:::

Returning to our lifelines plot:

* Red rectangle shows time interval for qualifying events $\theta$

<details>
<summary>Which individuals are in the cohort? **Tap for answer**</summary>
$A_4$ only
</details>

<img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/cohort_illustration-1.png" width="672" />


Can you think of any examples of a cohort outside of traditional demography?

* Customer analytics?
* Employee analytics?
* Mechanical engineering?
* Plant biology?

## Probabilities of occurrence of events

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

* **Probabilities** measure the **chance** an event occurs in a **cohort** within **a specific timeframe**
* **Rates** measure the the **pace** of occurrences per person-year in a **population**
:::

<details>
<summary>Why is a probability always cohort measure? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Because you have to define the range of possible starting points for observing whether an event occurs.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>Why does a probability require a specified timeframe? **Tap for answer**</summary>
Because if you don't specify the end of your observation period, somebody or something else will!

**Example**: All humans eventually die so the following probability is approximately equal to unity (aka 100%) and thus not all that useful:

$$
\frac{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \textsf{Number of deaths among people born in 1992} \\
    \textsf{from now until the heat death of the universe}
  \end{pmatrix}
}
{(\textsf{Number of people born in 1992})}
$$
