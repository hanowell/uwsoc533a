## Notes for 502 instructor Phil Hurvitz {.unnumbered}

* The `ccmpp` package implements the cohort component method of population projection (CCMPP) described in this section. There is an excellent vignette for this package, which gives a worked example of projection Thailand population from 1960 through 2000 using a baseline population for the year 1960: https://ihmeuw-demographics.github.io/demCore/articles/ccmpp.html
* I would show teach this worked example on the second day of this week so students can use the package to check their work if they want.
