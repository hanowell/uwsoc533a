What are the “processes” that the Stockholm University Demographic Unit’s definition drives at? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>
<strong>Birth:</strong> Entering the population from the womb</li>
<li>
<strong>Death:</strong> Exiting the population because we’re all mortal</li>
<li>
<strong>Migration:</strong> Physically moving in our out of the population’s location</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
What are three basic dimensions along which these changes occur? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>
<strong>Time:</strong> For example, you can track the number of deaths from year to year</li>
<li>
<strong>Space:</strong> You can track how a population moves its location over time, or how individuals move into our out of a local population over time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Structure:</strong> You can disaggregate a population into subpopulations. For example, by age, by race or ethnicity, by religion, by gender. This structure may change over time.</li>

<p>Let’s apply this lesson to a population a data scientist might work with:</p>
<center>
<strong>A company’s employee headcount grows</strong>

Analogies to in-migrations <span class="math inline">\(I[0,T]\)</span> and out-migrations <span class="math inline">\(O[0,T]\)</span>? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><p>If the population is defined as employees at the company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminations who remain in the workforce (out-migration)</li>
<li>Re-hires (in-migration)</li>
<li>Hires from other companies (in-migration again)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the population is defined as a subset of employees at company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfers into and out of departments, teams, job functions, etc.</li>

The book’s definition uses “person-years.” I used “person-periods.” Why? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>Most traditional demographic rates are annual. Why might that be?</li>

What about the numerator makes this not a demographic rate? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>It isn’t a count of occurrences</li>
<li>Instead, it’s a count of people at a point in time</li>

<p>Why does <span class="math inline">\(CGR = \overline{r}\)</span> only when growth rate is constant? Let’s examine three scenarios: early growth, late growth, and constant growth.</p>
<p>Look at the picture below:</p>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Starting and ending population sizes <span class="math inline">\(N(0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N(T)\)</span> are all the same</li>
<li>Thus numerators of the crude growth rates <span class="math inline">\(N(0) - N(T)\)</span> are all the same</li>
<li>Yet person years (areas under the curves) definitely aren’t the same! That is:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[PY[0,T]_{\text{early growth}} \neq PY[0,T]_{\text{late growth}} \neq PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore the crude growth rates won’t be equal either, that is:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{early growth}}}
\neq \frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{late growth}}}
\neq \frac{N(0) - N(T)}{PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}}}
= r^*
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Under constant growth rate <span class="math inline">\(r^*[0,T]\)</span>, person-years lived is:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\require{cancel}
PY[0,T]_{\text{constant growth}} = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r^*}

<ul>
<li>Thus CGR under <span class="math inline">\(r^*[0,1]\)</span> is:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[

  \cdot \frac{r^*}{\bcancel{N(T) - N(0)}}

<p>We just saw that under constant growth rate <span class="math inline">\(r^*\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Plugging in the right-hand side of Equation <a href="concepts-and-measures.html#eq:constantgrowthexpression">(1.6)</a> (our original expression for <span class="math inline">\(r^*\)</span> before we found it was also equal to <span class="math inline">\(CGR[0,T]\)</span>) and simplifying yields a handy approximation of person-years that requires only the starting and ending population size and the period length:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:pyconstantgrowth">\[\begin{equation}
    PY[0,T] = \frac{

<h3>Method 3: Average of starting and ending population counts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#person-periods-method3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you don’t have mid-period population <span class="math inline">\(N(T/2)\)</span>
</li>
<li>So long as you’ve collected data in <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 2 consecutive years, you’ve got <span class="math inline">\(N(0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N(T)\)</span>
</li>
<li>Like mid-period population, the average <span class="math inline">\(\left(N(0) + N(T)\right)/2\)</span> also assumes linear growth</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>
Why does average of starting and ending population assume linear growth? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><p>Remember the midpoint formula for the mid-point between two points on a line?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(x_m,y_m\right) = \left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Draw a line between <span class="math inline">\(N(0)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N(T)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plug in for times <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> values and populations <span class="math inline">\(N(t)\)</span> for for <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left(t_m,N_m\right) = \left(\frac{0+T}{2},\frac{N(0)+N(1)}{2}\right)
                       = \left(T/2,\frac{N(0)+N(1)}{2}\right)\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting-ending average <span class="math inline">\(\left(N(0)+N(1)\right/2\)</span> is the mid-points’s <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinate</li>
<li>Mid-period <span class="math inline">\(T/2\)</span> is the mid-point’s <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate</li>
<li>Therefore the starting-ending average occurs at the mid-period</li>
<li>Recall that a mid-period approximation assumes linear <span class="math inline">\(N(t)\)</span>
</li>
</ul></details><details><summary>
Since both a mid-period approximation and a start-ending average approximation of <span class="math inline">\(PY\)</span> assume <span class="math inline">\(N(T)\)</span> is linear, does that mean they produce the same estimate of <span class="math inline">\(PY\)</span>?
</summary><p>Not unless <span class="math inline">\(N(t)\)</span> is in fact linear.</p>
<ul>
<li>With mid-period approximation, you assume <span class="math inline">\(PY = N(T/2) = \frac{1}{2} \left[N(0) + N(T)\right]\)</span> but don’t know <span class="math inline">\(N(0)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(N(T)\)</span>
</li>
<li>With start-ending average, you assume the same thing, but don’t know <span class="math inline">\(N(T/2)\)</span>
</li>
<li>Yet if <span class="math inline">\(N(t)\)</span> is non-linear, <span class="math inline">\(N(T/2) \neq \frac{1}{2} \left[N(0) + N(T)\right]\)</span>
</li>
</ul></details>

<h3>Method 4: Average of population counts at evenly spaced intervals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#method-4-average-of-population-counts-at-evenly-spaced-intervals"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recall <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,T] = \sum_{i=1}^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i\)</span>
</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> equally-sized intervals, this becomes <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \frac{1}{P}\)</span>
</li>
<li>This is simply the average of the per-interval population counts</li>
<li>Higher resolution (i.e., higher <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>) means better <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,T]\)</span> approximation</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate, let’s draw some graphs of average mid-interval estimates at different resolutions.</p>

<h3>The promise (and peril) of knowing exact person years<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#promise-and-peril"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In many business settings, data scientists have access to exact dates when individuals enter and exit a population.</p>
<details><summary>
What advantages does this provide? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>Precise estimation of person-periods</li>
<li>Thus precise estimation of rates</li>
<li>Flexible aggregation of occurrences in person-periods</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>
<p>Here’s an example of the flexibility of exact person year data. Recall the <a href="concepts-and-measures.html#balancing-data-science">attrition dataset</a> we worked with in our section on the balancing equation</p>
<details><summary>
Below is again a table of the raw data. Which variable would be summed into the numerator of an all-cause termination rate? The denominator? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>Sum of <code>left_company</code> is the occurrence in the numerator</li>
<li>Sum of <code>tenure</code> is the person-periods (specifically person-months) in the denominator</li>

<details><summary>
Below is the sum of terminations (<code>number_terminations</code>) and person-months (<code>employee_months</code>) for every combination of variables <code>gender</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>industry</code>, <code>commute_type</code>, <code>manager_gender</code>, along with the resulting <code>annualized_termination_rate</code>. How is an annual termination rate derived from terminations and person-months?
</summary><ul>
<li>If you already have the monthly rate: Multiply it by 12</li>
<li>Or you could have divided <code>employee_months</code> by 12 to get <code>employee_years</code>
</li>

<p>The beauty of exact person-periods is now we can get the same rates for a grouping of variables in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If starting with individual-level data, sum the <em>individual</em> occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate</li>
<li>If starting with pre-aggregated data, sum the <em>aggregated</em> occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example, summing the aggregates above to derive annualized termination rates by gender:</p>

What types of errors would you expect to see in exact person-year data? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>Exit date happened before entrance date</li>
<li>Missing exit date even if individual labeled as an exit</li>
<li>Missing entrance date even if there is an exit date</li>
<li>Exit and entrance dates both far into the future</li>
<li>Forgetting far-future exit dates are default values for no event</li>
</ul>
I have seen all of these and more. Thank now about how you’d deal with them.

<p><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Probabilities</strong> measure the <strong>chance</strong> an event occurs in a <strong>cohort</strong> within <strong>a specific timeframe</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\textsf{Probability} = \frac{
  \textsf{Number of occurrences }
}{
  \color{darkorange}{\textsf{Number of preceding events or trials}}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>Probabilities also specify a window of observation from…</p>
<ul>
<li>when the “preceding event or trial” qualifies for inclusion in the cohort…</li>
<li>… until either the event occurs or the individual stops being observed</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximal observation time needs to be same for each member of the cohort</p>
<p>Therefore each individual counted in the denominator needs to have been observed for at least as long as the duration of the observation window</p>
<p><strong>Rates</strong> measure the the <strong>pace</strong> of occurrences per person-year in a <strong>population</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\textsf{Rate} = \frac{
  \textsf{Number of occurrences} 
}{
  \color{dodgerblue}{\textsf{Number of person-periods lived}}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>Rates specify a window of observation, as well, but its starting point is not defined by entry of an individual into a cohort.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s defined by the start of the period of observation.</p>
<p>All occurrences and person-periods lived within observation window are counted</p>
<p>No occurrences or person-periods outside the observation window are counted</p>
</div>
<p>A lot of this will make way more sense when we study Lexis diagrams</p>
<details><summary>
Why does a probability require an observation window with a starting and ending point? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><p>Because if you don’t specify the end of your observation period, somebody or something else will!</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: All humans eventually die so the following probability is approximately equal to unity (aka 100%) and thus not all that useful:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \textsf{Number of deaths among people born in 1992} \\
    \textsf{from now until the heat death of the universe}
  \end{pmatrix}
}
{(\textsf{Number of people born in 1992})}
