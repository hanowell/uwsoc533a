<h3>Balancing equation a company’s employees<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#balancing-equation-a-companys-employees"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s apply this lesson to a population a data scientist might work with:</p>
<center>
<strong>A company’s employee headcount grows</strong>
</center>
<p>Think of analogies to the components of the balancing equation
<br><br></p>
<details><summary>
Analogy to births <span class="math inline">\(B[0,T]\)</span>?
</summary><p>New hires <span class="math inline">\(H[0,T]\)</span></p>
<p>What are some weaknesses of this analogy?<br><strong>Hint:</strong> Look at the source of <span class="math inline">\(B[0,T]\)</span> in that stock and flow chart</p>
<img src="images/balancing-equation-stock-flow.PNG" title="fig:" style="width:100.0%" alt="Balancing equation stock and flow chart again"></details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
Analogy to deaths <span class="math inline">\(D[0,T]\)</span>?
</summary><p>Terminations (aka “separations” for the Bureau of Labor Statistics) <span class="math inline">\(S[0,T]\)</span></p>
<p>What are some weaknesses of this deaths:terminations analogy?<br><strong>Hint:</strong> Look at the destination of <span class="math inline">\(D[0,T]\)</span> in that stock and flow chart</p>
<img src="images/balancing-equation-stock-flow.PNG" title="fig:" style="width:100.0%" alt="Balancing equation stock and flow chart again"></details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
Analogies to in-migrations and out-migrations <span class="math inline">\(B[0,T]\)</span>?
</summary><p>Transfers into and out of departments, teams, job functions, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>In-transfers <span class="math inline">\(I[0,T]\)</span>
</li>
<li>Out-transfers <span class="math inline">\(O[0,T]\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
Collection of employees in specific department, team, job function, etc.
</details><p><br></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Below is random sample from a data table of employees from a real Russian company<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Documented here: &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/davinwijaya/employee-turnover" class="uri"&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/davinwijaya/employee-turnover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>tenure</strong> is the number of months the employee worked at the company</li>
<li>
<strong>left_company</strong> equal 1 if the employee terminated, 0 otherwise</li>
<li>Notice the other attributes available like <strong>gender</strong> and <strong>age</strong>
</li>

<p><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Person-periods</strong> (e.g., person-years) are the sum across a population of all the time that individuals were exposed to the risk of some event.</p>
</div>
<details><summary>
From PHG, what type of rate is this? (Hint: Look in the “equation!”)
</summary><ul>
<li>Occurrence rate, or…</li>
<li>Exposure rate</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
The book’s definition uses “person-years.” I used “person-periods.” Why?
</summary><ul>
<li>Most traditional demographic rates are annual. Why might that be?</li>
<li>In some cases, another period length is more appropriate. Example?</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>
<div class="rmdimportant">
<p><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></p>
<p>A ratio ain’t a(n occurrence aka exposure) rate!</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The U.S. monthly unemployment “rate” (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm">U-3</a>) is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\textsf{Count of the unemployed from Current Population Survey (CPS)}}
       {\textsf{Count of the employed plus unemployed from CPS}}\]</span></p>
<details><summary>
What about the numerator makes this not a rate?
</summary><ul>
<li>It isn’t a count of occurrences</li>
<li>Instead, it’s a count of people at a point in time</li>
<li>Later, we’ll see that such counts are an estimate of monthly person-periods</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
What about the denominator makes this a funky unemployment “rate?”
</summary>
Unemployed people aren’t at risk of becoming unemployed
</details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
What could we change to make it a rate?
</summary><ul>
<li>Make the denominator a count of employed person-periods</li>
<li>Make the numerator a count of transitions from employment to unemployment</li>

<p>Let’s illustrate with a toy example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A population of 7 people</li>
<li>Observed over 1 calendar year…</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let’s look at the lifelines of each individual in the population…</p>

<p>Now, let’s look at how those life lines add up to person-years per quarter…</p>
<p>This shows how the person-years changes from quarter to quarter.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/person_years_by_quarter_plot-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>Let’s write down what’s going on:</p>

<p>Using conventional notation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span>: Number of persons alive in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> quarter of the year</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i\)</span>: Fraction of a year represented by that quarter (0.25 if the whole quarter is represented)
<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or more generally, for <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> discrete chunks of a period of potentially unequal length:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(PY[0,T] = \sum_1^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i\)</span></p>

What would <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i\)</span> equal if we counted people each day in 2021?

<ul>
<li>For 2022, it would be 366 because it’s a leap year</li>
<li>If our rate spanned across a multiple of four years, it would be 365.25 to account for leap and non-leap years</li>
<li>Why would <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i\)</span> be tedious to calculate if we did monthly counts?</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>

</summary>
Number of persons alive in the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> day of the year

🤓 Hypothetically, the most frequent count cadence possible is each chronon, and theoretically the most frequent count cadence possible is the Planck time, so maybe that integral is in the end a continuous approximation of quantized time. 🤓

<p>On pgs 13-14, PHG show that if you assume constant growth rate, you can estimate person years using starting and ending population counts:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:pyconstantgrowth">\[\begin{equation}
    PY[0,T] = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r[0,T]}
            = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{\text{ln}\left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}
  \tag{1.5}

<h3>Method 2: Use mid-period population<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#method-2-use-mid-period-population"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Often, demographers don’t have both start and ending population</li>
<li>Instead, they have a mid-period population count</li>
<li>Example: Decennial U.S. Census</li>
<li>Mid-period population estimate works best when within-period growth is linear
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are two scenarios of linear population change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The black dot shows when within-period population = <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,1]\)</span>
</li>
<li>Notice how it’s at mid-period</li>
<li>Note how the over-estimate in one half of the year is balanced by an under-estimate in the other half of the year</li>
</ul>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/linear_growth_plots-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>Below are scenarios of exponentially changing populations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice how mid-period population <span class="math inline">\(\neq PY[0,1]\)</span>
</li>
<li>Mid-period population <strong>over</strong>-estimates for exponential decline. Why?</li>
<li>Mid-period population <strong>under</strong>-estimates for exponential growth. Why?</li>
</ul>

<p>As periods get shorter, the linear approximation gets better</p>
<p>Check it out by zooming in on any point along the population curve below</p>

What advantages does this provide?
</summary><ul>
<li>Precise estimation of person-periods</li>
<li>Thus precise estimation of rates</li>
<li>Flexible aggregation of occurrences in person-periods

You’ll see an example of this method’s flexibility in CSDE 502!

What types of errors would you expect to see in exact person-year data?
</summary><ul>
<li>Exit date happened before entrance date</li>
<li>Missing exit date even if individual labeled as an exit</li>
<li>Missing entrance date even if there is an exit date</li>
<li>Exit and entrance dates both far into the future</li>
<li>Forgetting far-future exit dates are default values for no event</li>

<p><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Probabilities</strong> measure the <strong>chance</strong> an event occurs in a <strong>cohort</strong> within <strong>a specific timeframe</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Rates</strong> measure the the <strong>pace</strong> of occurrences per person-year in a <strong>population</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<details><summary>
Why is a probability always cohort measure?
</summary>
Because you have to define the range of possible starting points for observing whether an event occurs.
</details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
Why does a cohort require a specified timeframe?
</summary><p>Because if you don’t specify the end of your observation period, somebody or something else will!</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: All humans eventually die so the following probability is approximately equal to unity (aka 100%) and thus not all that useful:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \textsf{Number of deaths among people born in 1992} \\
