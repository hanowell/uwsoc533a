<p>Let’s apply this lesson to a population a data scientist might work with:</p>
<center>
<strong>A company’s employee headcount grows</strong>

<p>Think of analogies to the components of the balancing equation
<br><br></p>

<li>Thinking about the state “Death” below, what’s a potential weakness of this analogy?</li>

</ul>
<img src="images/balancing-equation-stock-flow.svg" title="fig:" style="width:100.0%" alt="Balancing equation stock and flow chart again"></details><p><br></p>

Analogies to in-migrations <span class="math inline">\(I[0,T]\)</span> and out-migrations <span class="math inline">\(O[0,T]\)</span>? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><p>If the population is defined as employees at the company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminations who remain in the workforce (out-migration)</li>
<li>Re-hires (in-migration)</li>
<li>Hires from other companies (in-migration again)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the population is defined as a subset of employees at company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfers into and out of departments, teams, job functions, etc.</li>
</ul></details><p><br></p>

The book’s definition uses “person-years.” I used “person-periods.” Why? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>

<p>On pgs 13-14, PHG show that if you assume constant growth rate, you can estimate person years using starting and ending population counts:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:pyconstantgrowth">\[\begin{equation}
    PY[0,T] = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{r[0,T]}
            = \frac{N(T) - N(0)}{\text{ln}\left[\frac{N(T)}{N(0)}\right]}
  \tag{1.5}

<h3>Method 2: Use mid-period population<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#method-2-use-mid-period-population"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Often, demographers don’t have both start and ending population</li>
<li>Instead, they have a mid-period population count</li>
<li>Example: Decennial U.S. Census</li>
<li>Mid-period population estimate works best when within-period growth is linear
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are two scenarios of linear population change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The black dot shows when within-period population = <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,1]\)</span>
</li>
<li>Notice how it’s at mid-period</li>
<li>Note how the mid-period’s under-estimate in one half of the year is balanced by an over-estimate in the other half of the year</li>
</ul>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="01_concepts-and-measures_files/figure-html/linear_growth_plots-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>Below are scenarios of exponentially changing populations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice how mid-period population <span class="math inline">\(\neq PY[0,1]\)</span>
</li>
<li>Mid-period population <strong>under</strong>-estimates <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,1]\)</span> in both cases. Why?</li>

<p>As periods get shorter, the linear approximation gets better</p>

<li>Like mid-period population, the mean <span class="math inline">\(\left(N(0) + N(T)\right)/2\)</span> also assumes linear growth</li>

<li>Recall <span class="math inline">\(PY[0,T] = \sum_{i=1}^{P} N_i \times \Delta_i\)</span>

<details><summary>
Below is the sum of terminations (<code>number_terminations</code>) and person-months (<code>employee_months</code>) for every combination of variables <code>gender</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>industry</code>, <code>commute_type</code>, <code>manager_gender</code>, along with the resulting <code>annualized_termination_rate</code>. How is an annual termination rate derived from terminations and person-months?
</summary><ul>
<li>If you already have the monthly rate: Multiply it by 12</li>
<li>Or you could have divided <code>employee_months</code> by 12 to get <code>employee_years</code>
</li>

<p>The beauty of exact person-periods is now we can get the same rates for a grouping of variables in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If starting with individual-level data, sum the <em>individual</em> occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate</li>
<li>If starting with pre-aggregated data, sum the <em>aggregated</em> occurrences and person-periods, then calculate the rate</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example, summing the aggregates above to derive annualized termination rates by gender:</p>

What types of errors would you expect to see in exact person-year data? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><ul>
<li>Exit date happened before entrance date</li>
<li>Missing exit date even if individual labeled as an exit</li>
<li>Missing entrance date even if there is an exit date</li>
<li>Exit and entrance dates both far into the future</li>
<li>Forgetting far-future exit dates are default values for no event</li>
</ul>
I have seen all of these and more. Thank now about how you’d deal with them.

<p>A <strong>cohort</strong> is an a group of individuals in a population that experience a specific event during a specific time interval.</p>

<p><strong>KEY CONCEPT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Probabilities</strong> measure the <strong>chance</strong> an event occurs in a <strong>cohort</strong> within <strong>a specific timeframe</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Rates</strong> measure the the <strong>pace</strong> of occurrences per person-year in a <strong>population</strong>
</li>

<details><summary>
Why is a probability always cohort measure? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary>
Because you have to define the range of possible starting points for observing whether an event occurs.
</details><p><br></p>
<details><summary>
Why does a probability require a specified timeframe? <strong>Tap for answer</strong>
</summary><p>Because if you don’t specify the end of your observation period, somebody or something else will!</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: All humans eventually die so the following probability is approximately equal to unity (aka 100%) and thus not all that useful:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \textsf{Number of deaths among people born in 1992} \\

}
{(\textsf{Number of people born in 1992})}
