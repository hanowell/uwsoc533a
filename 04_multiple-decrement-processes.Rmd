# Multiple decrement processes

:::{.rmdimportant}
**KEY CONCEPT**

A **multiple decrement process** extends a single decrement process to consider multiple modes of exit.

A **multiple decrement life table** is a tabular summary of such a process.
:::

## Multiple decrement tables for a real cohort

## Multiple decrement life tables for periods

## Some basic mathematics of multiple decrement processes

:::{.rmdnote}
### Multiple decrement tables assume independent competing risks

#### Courses to take to learn how to relax this assumption

#### Resources for learning about competing risk analysis

## Associated single decrement tables from period data

## Cause-specific decomposition of differences in life expectancies

## Associated single decrement tables from current status data

## Stationary population with multiple sources of decrement
